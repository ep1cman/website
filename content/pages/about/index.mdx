Hey!

I'm Sebastian Goscik - A UK based maker, hacker and engineer. I am currently working as a *developer evangelist*
[@arm](http://arm.com). I graduated with a BEng in Electronic Engineering from the University of 
Surrey in 2017. Since graduating I have focused on technology communication. Working as a developer evangelist,  developing large scale tech demos for major trade shows, and running workshops/courses.

In my spare time I enjoy all forms of "making", whether that be 3D printing, Coding, Woodwork, Baking or creating
fantasy worlds as a D&D Dungeon Master. I'm also an avid video/board gamer.
